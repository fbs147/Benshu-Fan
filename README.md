My name is **Ben-Shu Fan(ËåÉÊú¨Êæç)**. I a HQI Postdoctoral Fellow at Tsinghua University.
I am currently working on the Condensed Matter Physics.  

Especially, I am currently working on the following topics:
* **Light-matter Interaction**:
  - Pseudospin-selective Floquet band engineering in black phosphorus, *Shaohua Zhou, Changhua Bao, Benshu Fan, Hui Zhou, Qixuan Gao, Haoyuan Zhong, Tianyun Lin, Hang Liu, Pu Yu, Peizhe Tang, Sheng Meng, Wenhui Duan, Shuyun Zhou‚Ä†*, **Nature 614, 75‚Äì80 (2023)**: [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05610-3); **Arxiv**: [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00604.pdf); **News&Views**: [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00225-8); **Reports**: [Phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2023-02-floquet-band-black-phosphorus.html) & [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1245/11903.htm) & [Department of Physics](https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1229/5445.htm)
